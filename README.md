# Cyber Security Intrusion Detection Model

In today's increasingly interconnected world, the need for robust cybersecurity measures is paramount. As cyber threats continue to evolve and grow in sophistication, it is crucial to develop effective intrusion detection systems to safeguard sensitive networks and systems. The objective of this project is to design and implement a robust intrusion detection model using a dataset generated from a simulated military network environment.
